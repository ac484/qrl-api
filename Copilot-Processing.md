User request: Integrate protobuf message handling for websocket proto definitions located in src/app/infrastructure/external/proto/websocket-proto/*.proto with protobuf==4.25.1 already in requirements. Main.py already imports google.protobuf.message and json_format. Need to apply proto definitions accordingly.
